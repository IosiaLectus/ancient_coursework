# ancient_coursework
This repository contains code I wrote for a seried of courses I took in high school, title 'Object Oriented Programming With Java', 'Data Structures I', and 'Data Structures II'. Unfortunatley, since that time, my Java has rusted a bit, but I intend to include here the original versions, and perhaps later will work on refactoring them.
